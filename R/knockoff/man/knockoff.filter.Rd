\usage{
knockoff.filter(
  X,
  y,
  knockoffs = create.second_order,
  statistic = stat.glmnet_coefdiff,
  fdr = 0.1,
  offset = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{n-by-p matrix or data frame of predictors.}

\item{y}{response vector of length n.}

\item{knockoffs}{method used to construct knockoffs for the \eqn{X} variables.
It must be a function taking a n-by-p matrix as input and returning a n-by-p matrix of knockoff variables. 
By default, approximate model-X Gaussian knockoffs are used.}

\item{statistic}{statistics used to assess variable importance. By default, 
a lasso statistic with cross-validation is used. See the Details section for more information.}

\item{fdr}{target false discovery rate (default: 0.1).}

\item{offset}{either 0 or 1 (default: 1). This is the offset used to compute the rejection threshold on the
statistics. The value 1 yields a slightly more conservative procedure ("knockoffs+") that
controls the false discovery rate (FDR) according to the usual definition, 
while an offset of 0 controls a modified FDR.}
}
\value{
An object of class "knockoff.result". This object is a list 
 containing at least the following components:
 \item{X}{matrix of original variables}
 \item{Xk}{matrix of knockoff variables}
 \item{statistic}{computed test statistics}
 \item{threshold}{computed selection threshold}
 \item{selected}{named vector of selected variables}
}
\description{
This function runs the Knockoffs procedure from start to finish, selecting variables
relevant for predicting the outcome of interest.
}
\details{
This function creates the knockoffs, computes the importance statistics, 
and selects variables. 
It is the main entry point for the knockoff package.



The parameter \code{knockoffs} controls how knockoff variables are created.
By default, the model-X scenario is assumed and a multivariate normal distribution 
is fitted to the original variables \eqn{X}. The estimated mean vector and the covariance 
matrix are used to generate second-order approximate Gaussian knockoffs.
In general, the function \code{knockoffs} should take a n-by-p matrix of
observed variables \eqn{X} as input and return a n-by-p matrix of knockoffs.
Two default functions for creating knockoffs are provided with this package.

In the model-X scenario, under the assumption that the rows of \eqn{X} are distributed 
as a multivariate Gaussian with known parameters, then the function 
\code{create.gaussian} can be used to generate Gaussian knockoffs, 
as shown in the examples below.

In the fixed-X scenario, one can create the knockoffs using the function 
\code{create.fixed}. This requires \eqn{n \geq p} and it assumes 
that the response \eqn{Y} follows a homoscedastic linear regression model.

For more information about creating knockoffs, type \code{??create}.

The default importance statistic is \link{stat.glmnet_coefdiff}.
For a complete list of the statistics provided with this package, 
type \code{??stat}.

It is possible to provide custom functions for the knockoff constructions 
or the importance statistics. Some examples can be found in the vignette.
